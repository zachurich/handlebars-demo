## Project 3

### This project uses gulp.js as it's primary build system for compiling SASS into normal CSS

### Compiled un-minified CSS lives in the build directory

I'm using autoprefixer as a POSTCSS plugin so I don't have to worry about those pesky vendor prefixes

To get started using gulp:

1. Install Node.js

2. Run "npm install" from the root directory to get all dependencies

3. Run "gulp" to compile SASS into CSS

That's it!
